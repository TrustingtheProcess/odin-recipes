 <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Grilled lemon pepper chicken is a tantalizing dish that marries the smokey char of grilled chicken with the bright,
      zesty flavors of lemon and the aromatic punch of cracked black pepper. Picture succulent chicken breasts or thighs,
      marinated in a vibrant blend of freshly squeezed lemon juice, zest, olive oil, garlic, and a generous sprinkling of cracked black pepper,
      infusing the meat with layers of tangy and spicy goodness.
      As it grills to perfection, the chicken develops a beautifully caramelized exterior, locking in moisture and creating a tantalizing contrast to the tender, juicy meat inside.
      The lemon adds a refreshing acidity that cuts through the richness of the chicken, while the pepper lends a subtle heat and earthiness that enhances the overall flavor profile.
      Served hot off the grill, this dish is a celebration of simplicity and flavor, perfect for a summer barbecue or a cozy weeknight dinner.
      Whether enjoyed on its own or paired with vibrant sides like roasted vegetables, crisp salads, or fluffy rice, grilled lemon pepper chicken is sure to
      delight the senses with its irresistible combination of textures and flavors.</p>
